{\bf Problem set on Complex Numbers }\\

Each of the following problems is worth 40 points. \\

\emph{Important reminder: to get full credit, all calculations must be done by hand, without using electronic devices. Steps must be reasonably detailed.  The use of electronic devices is allowed, but must be explicitly declared, and will result in partial credit. See syllabus for details. Also see syllabus for rules on collaborating with others on a problem.   }  

\begin{enumerate}


\item  Textbook, exercise 3.15. (Note: because the results are given at the end of the chapter, most of the  credit will be given for steps. ) 

[Hint:  show that it is possible to factorize the equation as follows: $(z^3-2)(a z^4 + b z^3 + c z^2 + d z + e)=0$, with $a,b,c,d,e$ to be found. ]

\item  Textbook, exercise 3.19.

\item  Textbook, exercise 3.26.

\item  Textbook, exercise 3.28.
